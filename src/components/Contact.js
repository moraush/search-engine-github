  <p>Tourism has traditionally been the third largest foreign exchange
  earner in the country. Sri Lanka recorded over 1.9 million tourist
  arrivals in 2019, a 21 percent drop from the previous year owing to the
   aftermath of the Easter Terror Attacks. It is estimated that the sector
   earned around $3.5 billion in 2019. The effects of the global COVID-19
   pandemic crippled the sector in 2020</p>
